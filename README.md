# Optical Physics Simulation ðŸ”¬

## Overview
This project simulates the interaction of light with various materials, using principles from optical physics such as reflection, refraction, and scattering. The model integrates mathematical functions for precise calculations of how light behaves when it encounters surfaces with different refractive indices.

## Physics Principles
The interaction of light with materials is governed by fundamental principles such as:
- **Reflection**: Modeled using the Fresnel equations, which determine how much light is reflected versus refracted when it strikes a surface.
- **Refraction**: Based on Snellâ€™s Law, this simulation calculates how light bends when passing through different media with varying refractive indices.
- **Absorption and Scattering**: Simulated using differential equations to capture the energy lost as light passes through semi-transparent or opaque materials.

## Methodology
1. **Mathematical Modeling**: I implemented mathematical models to calculate the behavior of light at the interface of two materials, considering both reflective and refractive phenomena.
   
2. **Efficient Computation**: The simulation utilizes NumPy for fast matrix calculations, ensuring that light paths are computed efficiently, even in complex environments.

3. **Data Visualization**: Light paths are plotted using Matplotlib, visualizing the angles of reflection and refraction. The simulation supports different light sources and materials, providing a comprehensive view of optical interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
