# Optical Physics Simulation ðŸ”¬

## Overview
This project models light propagation, reflection, and refraction based on principles of optical physics. Using Python, the simulation visualizes how light interacts with various surfaces, depicting physical behaviors such as scattering and refraction.

## Key Features
- **Light Propagation Simulation**: Modeled the path of light beams as they interact with surfaces.
- **Mathematical Models**: Incorporated complex formulas governing reflection, refraction, and absorption of light.
- **Visualization**: Used Matplotlib to create detailed plots of light paths and surface interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheLord2K/optical-physics-simulation.git
